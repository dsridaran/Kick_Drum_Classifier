Default is 1.0.\n","*   **type** (string): Section of sound audio to retain if **x_percent** is not 1.0. Options include \"start\", \"center\", \"end\", or \"random\".\n","*   **noise_factor** (float): Articifical noise factor to add to raw audio. Default is 0.0.\n","*   **verbose** (bool): Outputs printed if True. Default is False.\n","*   **epochs** (int): Number of epochs to train model. Default is 3.\n","*   **batch_size** (int): Batch sizes to train model. Default is 32.\n","*   **validation_split** (float): Validation split to evaluate model.
