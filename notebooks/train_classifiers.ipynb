Model training is performed by calling the **train_classifer()** function, which has parameters:\n","\n","*   **model_name** (str): User-defined name of model.\n","*   **model_save** (bool): Will save model if True. Default is True.\n","*   **overwrite** (bool): Will overwrite existing models with same name if True. Default is False.\n","*   **drum_path** (str): File path to drum audio samples for training. Default is '../data/raw/drum'.\n","*   **kick_path** (str): File path to kick audio samples for training. Default is '../data/raw/kick'.\n","*   **x_train_labs** (list): Optional list of matches from data folders over which to train model. Remaining matches within each folder are held for testing. Default is None, meaning model is trained and tested using random partitions.\n","*   **x_percent** (float): Percentage of 0.4 second audio to train model. Default is 1.0.\n","*   **type** (string): Section of sound audio to retain if **x_percent** is not 1.0. Options include \"start\", \"center\", \"end\", or \"random\".\n","*   **noise_factor** (float): Articifical noise factor to add to raw audio. Default is 0.0.\n","*   **verbose** (bool): Outputs printed if True. Default is False.\n","*   **epochs** (int): Number of epochs to train model. Default is 3.\n","*   **batch_size** (int): Batch sizes to train model. Default is 32.\n","*   **validation_split** (float): Validation split to evaluate model. Default is 0.2.\n","*   **seed** (int): Seed for reproducability. Default is 1.\n","*   **plot_cm** (bool): Plots confusion matrix if True.
